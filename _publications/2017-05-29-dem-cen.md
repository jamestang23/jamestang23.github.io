title: "Decoding early myelopoiesis from dynamics of core endogenous network"
permalink: /publications/2017-05-29
excerpt: "A decade ago mainstream molecular biologists regarded it impossible or biologically ill-motivated to understand the dynamics of
complex biological phenomena, such as cancer genesis and progression, from a network perspective. Indeed, there are numerical
difficulties even for those who were determined to explore along this direction. Undeterred, sevenyears ago a group of Chinese
scientists started a program aiming to obtain quantitative connections between tumors and network dynamics. Many interesting
results have been obtained. In this paper we wish to test such idea from a different angle: the connection between a normal
biological process and the network dynamics. We have taken early myelopoiesis as our biological model. A standard roadmap
for the cell-fate diversification during hematopoiesis has already been well established experimentally, yet little was known
for its underpinning dynamical mechanisms. Compounding this difficulty there were additional experimental challenges, such
as the seemingly conflicting hematopoietic roadmaps and the cell-fate inter-conversion events. With early myeloid cell-fate
determination in mind, we constructed a core molecular endogenous network from well-documented gene regulation and signal
transduction knowledge. Turning the network into a set of dynamical equations, we found computationally several structurally
robust states. Those states nicely correspond to known cell phenotypes. We also found the states connecting those stable states.
They reveal the developmental routesâ€”how one stable state would most likely turn into another stable state. Such interconnected
network among stable states enabled a natural organization of cell-fates into a multi-stable state landscape. Accordingly, both the
myeloid cell phenotypes and the standard roadmap were explained mechanistically in a straightforward manner. Furthermore,
recent challenging observations were also explained naturally. Moreover, the landscape visually enables a prediction of a pool of
additional cell states and developmental routes, including the non-sequential and cross-branch transitions, which are testable by
future experiments. In summary, the endogenous network dynamics provide an integrated quantitative framework to understand
the heterogeneity and lineage commitment in myeloid progenitors."
