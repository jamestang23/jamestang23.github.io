title: "Nonequilibrium work relation beyond the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution"
category: articles
permalink: /publications/2014-06-09
excerpt: "The presence of multiplicative noise can alter measurements of forces acting on nanoscopic objects. Taking into
account of multiplicative noise, we derive a series of nonequilibrium thermodynamical equalities as generalization
of the Jarzynski equality, the detailed fluctuation theorem and the Hatano-Sasa relation. Our result demonstrates
that the Jarzynski equality and the detailed fluctuation theorem remains valid only for systems with the BoltzmannGibbs distribution at the equilibrium state, but the Hatano-Sasa relation is robust with respect to different stochastic
interpretations of multiplicative noise."
