title: "Quantifying information of intracellular signaling:progress with machine learning"
permalink: /publications/2022-07-12
excerpt: "Cells convey information about their extracellular environment to their core functional
machineries. Studying the capacity of intracellular signaling pathways to transmit information
addresses fundamental questions about living systems. Here, we review how
information-theoretic approaches have been used to quantify information transmission by
signaling pathways that are functionally pleiotropic and subject to molecular stochasticity. We
describe how recent advances in machine learning have been leveraged to address the
challenges of complex temporal trajectory datasets and how these have contributed to our
understanding of how cells employ temporal coding to appropriately adapt to environmental
perturbations."
