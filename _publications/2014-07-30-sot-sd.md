title: "Summing over trajectories of stochastic dynamics with multiplicative noise"
category: articles
permalink: /publications/2014-07-30
excerpt: "We demonstrate that previous path integral formulations for the general stochastic interpretation generate incomplete results exemplified by the geometric Brownian motion. We thus
develop a novel path integral formulation for the overdamped Langevin equation with multiplicative noise. The present path integral leads to the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation, and naturally generates a normalized transition probability in examples. Our result solves the inconsistency of the previous path integral formulations for the general stochastic interpretation, and can have wide applications in chemical and physical stochastic processes."
