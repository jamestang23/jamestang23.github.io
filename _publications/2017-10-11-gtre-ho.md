title: "Generating transverse response explicitly from harmonic oscillator"
permalink: /publications/2017-10-11
excerpt: "We obtain stochastic dynamics from a system-plus-bath mechanism as an extension of the Caldeira-Leggett
(CL) model in the classical regime. An effective magnetic field and response functions with both longitudinal
and transverse parts are exactly generated from the bath of harmonic oscillators. The effective magnetic field
and transverse response are antisymmetric matrices: the former is explicitly time-independent corresponding
to the geometric magnetism, while the latter can have memory. The present model can be reduced to previous
representative examples of stochastic dynamics describing nonequilibrium processes. Our results demonstrate
that a system coupled with a bath of harmonic oscillators is a general approach to studying stochastic dynamics,
and provides a method to experimentally implement an effective magnetic field from coupling to the environment."
