title: "Reversed graph embedding resolves complex single-cell trajectories"
permalink: /publications/2017-08-21
excerpt: "Single-cell trajectories can unveil how gene regulation governs 
cell fate decisions. However, learning the structure of complex 
trajectories with multiple branches remains a challenging 
computational problem. We present Monocle 2, an algorithm 
that uses reversed graph embedding to describe multiple fate 
decisions in a fully unsupervised manner. We applied Monocle 2 
to two studies of blood development and found that mutations 
in the genes encoding key lineage transcription factors divert 
cells to alternative fates."
