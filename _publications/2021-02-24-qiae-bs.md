title: "Quantifying information accumulation encoded in the dynamics of biochemical signaling"
permalink: /publications/2021-02-24
excerpt: "Cellular responses to environmental changes are encoded in the complex temporal patterns
of signaling proteins. However, quantifying the accumulation of information over time to
direct cellular decision-making remains an unsolved challenge. This is, in part, due to the
combinatorial explosion of possible configurations that need to be evaluated for information
in time-course measurements. Here, we develop a quantitative framework, based on inferred
trajectory probabilities, to calculate the mutual information encoded in signaling dynamics
while accounting for cell-cell variability. We use it to understand NFκB transcriptional
dynamics in response to different immune threats, and reveal that some threats are distinguished faster than others. Our analyses also suggest specific temporal phases during
which information distinguishing threats becomes available to immune response genes; one
specific phase could be mapped to the functionality of the IκBα negative feedback circuit. The
framework is generally applicable to single-cell time series measurements, and enables
understanding how temporal regulatory codes transmit information over time."
