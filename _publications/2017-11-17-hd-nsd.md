excerpt: "Quantifying stochastic processes is essential to understand many natural phenomena, particularly 
in biology, including the cell-fate decision in developmental processes as well as the genesis and 
progression of cancers. While various attempts have been made to construct potential landscape in 
high dimensional systems and to estimate transition rates, they are practically limited to the cases 
where either noise is small or detailed balance condition holds. A general and practical approach to 
investigate real-world nonequilibrium systems, which are typically high-dimensional and subject to 
large multiplicative noise and the breakdown of detailed balance, remains elusive. Here, we formulate 
a computational framework that can directly compute the relative probabilities between locally 
stable states of such systems based on a least action method, without the necessity of simulating 
the steady-state distribution. The method can be applied to systems with arbitrary noise intensities 
through A-type stochastic integration, which preserves the dynamical structure of the deterministic 
counterpart dynamics. We demonstrate our approach in a numerically accurate manner through 
solvable examples. We further apply the method to investigate the role of noise on tumor heterogeneity 
in a 38-dimensional network model for prostate cancer, and provide a new strategy on controlling cell 
populations by manipulating noise strength"
