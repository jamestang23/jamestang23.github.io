title: "SDE decomposition and A-type stochastic interpretation in nonequilibrium processes"
category: articles
permalink: /publications/2017-09-17
excerpt: "An innovative theoretical framework for stochastic dynamics based on the decomposition of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) into a dissipative component, a detailed-balance-breaking component,
and a dual-role potential landscape has been developed, which has fruitful applications in physics,
engineering, chemistry, and biology. It introduces the A-type stochastic interpretation of the SDE
beyond the traditional Ito or Stratonovich interpretation or even the Î±-type interpretation for multidimensional systems. The potential landscape serves as a Hamiltonian-like function in nonequilibrium
processes without detailed balance, which extends this important concept from equilibrium statistical
physics to the nonequilibrium region. A question on the uniqueness of the SDE decomposition was
recently raised. Our review of both the mathematical and physical aspects shows that uniqueness is
guaranteed. The demonstration leads to a better understanding of the robustness of the novel framework. In addition, we discuss related issues including the limitations of an approach to obtaining the
potential function from a steady-state distribution."
