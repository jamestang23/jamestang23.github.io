title: "A deep learning model for type II polyketide natural product prediction without sequence alignment"
permalink: /publications/2023-08-29
excerpt: "Natural products are important sources for drug development, and the accurate prediction of their
structures assembled by modular proteins is an area of great interest. In this study, we introduce
DeepT2, an end-to-end, cost-effective, and accurate machine learning platform to accelerate the
identification of type II polyketides (T2PKs), which represent a significant portion of the natural product
world. Our algorithm is based on advanced natural language processing models and utilizes the core
biosynthetic enzyme, chain length factor (CLF or KSb), as computing inputs. The process involves
sequence embedding, data labeling, classifier development, and novelty detection, which enable precise
classification and prediction directly from KSb without sequence alignments. Combined with
metagenomics and metabolomics, we evaluated the ability of DeepT2 and found this model could easily
detect and classify KSb either as a single sequence or a mixture of bacterial genomes, and subsequently
identify the corresponding T2PKs in a labeled categorized class or as novel. Our work highlights deep
learning as a promising framework for genome mining and therefore provides a meaningful platform for
discovering medically important natural products. The DeepT2 is available at GitHub repository:"
