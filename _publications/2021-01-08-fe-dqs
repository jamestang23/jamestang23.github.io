title: "Free energy amplification by magnetic flux for driven quantum systems"
permalink: /publications/2021-01-08
excerpt: "Exploring the source of free energy is of practical use for thermodynamical systems. In the
classical regime, the free energy change is independent of magnetism, as the Lorentz force is
conservative. In contrast, here we find that the free energy change can be amplified by adding
a magnetic field to driven quantum systems. Taking a recent experimental system as an
example, the predicted amplification becomes 3-fold when adding a 10-tesla magnetic field
under temperature 316 nanoKelvin. We further uncover the mechanism by examining the
driving process. Through extending the path integral approach for quantum thermodynamics,
we obtain a generalized free energy equality for both closed and open quantum systems. The
equality reveals a decomposition on the source of the free energy change: one is the quantum
work functional, and the other emerges from the magnetic flux passing through a closed loop
of propagators. The result suggests a distinct quantum effect of magnetic flux and supports
to extract additional free energy from the magnetic field."
