title: "Controlling symmetry-breaking states by a hidden quantity in multiplicative noise"
category: articles
permalink: /publications/2014-11-14
excerpt: "The inhomogeneity of multiplicative white noise leads to various coupling modes between deterministic and
stochastic forces. We investigate the phase transition induced by the variation of the coupling mode through
manipulating its characteristic parameter continuously. Even when the noise strength is fixed, an increase of this
parameter can enhance or inhibit the symmetry-breaking state. We also propose a scheme to implement these
phase transitions experimentally. Our result demonstrates that the coupling mode previously considered to be a
mathematical convention serves as an additional quantity leading to physically observable phase transitions. This
observation provides a mechanism to control the effect of noise without regulating the noise strength."
