title: "Chemotaxis as a navigation strategy to boost range expansion"

excerpt: "Bacterial chemotaxis, the directed movement of cells along gradients of 
chemoattractants, is among the best-characterized subjects in molecular biology1–10, 
but much less is known about its physiological roles11. It is commonly seen as a 
starvation response when nutrients run out, or as an escape response from harmful 
situations12–16. Here we identify an alternative role of chemotaxis by systematically 
examining the spatiotemporal dynamics of Escherichia coli in soft agar12,17,18. 
Chemotaxis in nutrient-replete conditions promotes the expansion of bacterial 
populations into unoccupied territories well before nutrients run out in the current 
environment. Low levels of chemoattractants act as aroma-like cues in this process, 
establishing the direction and enhancing the speed of population movement along 
the self-generated attractant gradients. This process of navigated range expansion 
spreads faster and yields larger population gains than unguided expansion following 
the canonical Fisher–Kolmogorov dynamics19,20 and is therefore a general strategy to 
promote population growth in spatially extended, nutrient-replete environments."
