title: "An incoherent feedforward loop interprets NFκB/RelA dynamics to determine TNF-induced necroptosis decisions"
permalink: /publications/2020-12-14
excerpt: "Balancing cell death is essential to maintain healthy tissue homeostasis and prevent disease. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) not only
activates nuclear factor κB (NFκB), which coordinates the cellular
response to inflammation, but may also trigger necroptosis, a proinflammatory form of cell death. Whether TNF-induced NFκB
affects the fate decision to undergo TNF-induced necroptosis is
unclear. Live-cell microscopy and model-aided analysis of death
kinetics identified a molecular circuit that interprets TNF-induced
NFκB/RelA dynamics to control necroptosis decisions. Inducible
expression of TNFAIP3/A20 forms an incoherent feedforward loop
to interfere with the RIPK3-containing necrosome complex and
protect a fraction of cells from transient, but not long-term TNF
exposure. Furthermore, dysregulated NFκB dynamics often associated with disease diminish TNF-induced necroptosis. 
Our results
suggest that TNF’s dual roles in either coordinating cellular
responses to inflammation, or further amplifying inflammation are
determined by a dynamic NFκB-A20-RIPK3 circuit, that could be
targeted to treat inflammation and cancer."
