landscape, quasi-potential, A-type integral and beyond"

excerpt: "Recently Zhou and Li (ZL)1
extensively discussed
connections among three known ways of finding potential
landscapes for generic nonequilibrium processes in biology,
chemistry, engineering, and physics described by stochastic
differential equations (SDEs). Some interesting questions
were formulated, along with a few insightful results. They
speculated that a set of differential equations proposed 10 years
ago, referred to as “SDE decomposition” by ZL, would have
generally no unique solution. In this comment, we show that
such speculation is not supported by either mathematical or
physical reasoning. A few more points raised by ZL are further
clarified"
