title: "Work relations connecting nonequilibrium steady states without detailed balance"
category: articles
permalink: /publications/2015-04-07
excerpt: "Bridging equilibrium and nonequilibrium statistical physics attracts sustained interest. Hallmarks of
nonequilibrium systems include a breakdown of detailed balance, and an absence of a priori potential function
corresponding to the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution, without which classical equilibrium thermodynamical
quantities could not be defined. Here, we construct dynamically the potential function through decomposing
the system into a dissipative part and a conservative part, and develop a nonequilibrium theory by defining
thermodynamical quantities based on the potential function. Concepts for equilibrium can thus be naturally
extended to nonequilibrium steady state. We elucidate this procedure explicitly in a class of time-dependent
linear diffusive systems without mathematical ambiguity. We further obtain the exact work distribution for an
arbitrary control parameter, and work equalities connecting nonequilibrium steady states. Our results provide
a direct generalization on Jarzynski equality and Crooks fluctuation theorem to systems without detailed
balance."
