title: "Dynamical behaviors determined by the Lyapunov function in competitive Lotka-Volterra systems
permalink: /publications/2013-01-16
excerpt: "Dynamical behaviors of the competitive Lotka-Volterra system even for 3 species are not fully understood.
In this paper, we study this problem from the perspective of the Lyapunov function. We construct explicitly the
Lyapunov function using three examples of the competitive Lotka-Volterra system for the whole state space: (1)
the general 2-species case, (2) a 3-species model, and (3) the model of May-Leonard. The basins of attraction for
these examples are demonstrated, including cases with bistability and cyclical behavior. The first two examples
are the generalized gradient system, where the energy dissipation may not follow the gradient of the Lyapunov
function. In addition, under a new type of stochastic interpretation, the Lyapunov function also leads to the
Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution on the final steady state when multiplicative noise is added."
