title: "Anomalous free energy changes induced by topology"
category: articles
permalink: /publications/2015-12-16
excerpt: "We report that nontrivial topology of a driven Brownian particle restricted on a ring leads to anomalous
behaviors on free energy change. Starting from steady states with identical distribution and current on the ring,
free energy changes are distinct and nonperiodic after the system is driven by the same periodic force protocol.
We demonstrate our observation in examples through both exact solutions and numerical simulations. The free
energy calculated here can be measured in recent experimental systems."
